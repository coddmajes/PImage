Tools: VS2012

Including **Image transform, Image enhancement, Image restoration, Segmentation**

**1. Image transform, DFT, DCT**

    a. Open and show a file with different file extensions.(BMP/JPG/GIF/TIF/PNG,etc)
    
    b. DFT, IDFT and their spectrums
    
    c. DCT, IDCT and their spectrums

**2. Image enhancement: Gray-scale transformation, Histogram, Histogram equalization, Histogram specification, Spatial smoothing, Spatial sharpening**

    a.	Gray-scale transformation：reverse, piecewise linear transformation, logarithmic transformation, etc
    
    b.	Gray histogram
    
    c.	Histogram equalization；
    
    d.	Histogram specification: shape of traget histogram is equal to a Isosceles triangle
    
    e.	Spatial smoothing: offer differents smoothing filters, such as median filter, mean filter, etc
    
    f.	Spatial sharpening: offer differents sharpening filters, such as Robert, Sobel, etc
    
**3. Image enhancement: Low-pass filtering, High-pass filter**

    a.	High-pass filter: ideal // Butterworth // Gaussian low-pass filter
    
    b.	Low-pass filtering: ideal // Butterworth // Gaussian high-pass filter

**4. Image restoration by using inverse filter**
    
**5. Segmentation**

    a.	 Human segmentation: threshold, edge detection and region based methods
    
    b.	 Face recognition
    
    c.	 Save and label the results of 5.a and 5.b
    
    d.	Face segmentation: obtain and save different regions of forehead, cheeks, nose and chin
